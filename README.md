## Background

[Raft is a fault-tolerant consensus algorithm](https://raft.github.io/) that allows a number of peers to agree on a State. Each peer can submit updates to that State, which are then distributed and agreed upon.

[Hashicorp's Raft](https://github.com/hashicorp/raft) is a mature implementation of the algorithm, which includes a number of performance improvements over the original version and a modular approach that allows to replace pieces of the system with custom implementations.

[LibP2P](https://github.com/libp2p) provides a modular peer-to-peer networking stack, which simplifies the networking layer by adding features like generic addressing, secure channels, protocol multiplexing over single connections or nat traversal in a standarized fashion.

`go-libp2p-raft` uses Hashicorp's Raft implementation and provides a LibP2P-based network transport for it. At the same time, it wraps the whole system with an implementation of the `go-libp2p-consensus` interface, ensuring any applications relying on it can easily swap it for a different one.

In short, `go-libp2p-raft`:

  * can be used to implement raft-consensus-based systems
  * takes advantange of the libp2p features (secure channels, protocol multiplexing, nat transversal...)
  * takes advantage of Hashicorp's Raft implementation matureness and performance improvementes (pipelining)
  * forms a layer which can easily be replaced by a different `go-libp2p-consensus` implementation.


## Install

`go-libp2p-raft` works like a regular Go module:

Fetch with:

```
> go get -u github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-raft
```

You can use the [Gx](https://github.com/whyrusleeping/gx)-pinned dependencies running:

```
> make
```

## Usage

The documentation and examples for this module can be found in [godoc.org/github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-raft](https://godoc.org/github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-raft).
