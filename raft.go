// Package libp2praft implements the go-libp2p-consensus interface
// wrapping the github.com/hashicorp/raft implementation, providing
// a custom generic FSM to handle states and generic operations and
// giving the user a go-libp2p-based network transport to use.
//
// The main entry points to this library are the Consensus and Actor
// types. Usually, the first step is to create the Consensus, then
// use the *Consensus.FSM() object to initialize a Raft instance, along with
// the Libp2pTransport. With a Raft instance, an Actor can be
// created and then used with Consensus.SetActor(). From this point,
// the consensus system is ready to use.
//
// It is IMPORTANT to make a few notes about the types of objects
// to be used as consensus.State and consensus.Op, since the
// go-libp2p-consensus interface does not make many assumptions
// about them (consensus.State being an empty interface).
//
// In order for go-libp2p-raft to work properly, instances of
// consensus.State and consensus.Op are going to be serialized
// and transmitted between nodes. This imposes limitations on
// how these instances look like.
//
// Any consensus.State or consensus.Op is expected any relevant
// fields as exported fields. Unexported fields are not serialized,
// they are not transmitted, not received and deserialized
// in other nodes. Unexported fields stay at the value provided by
// the state and op initializers in the NewConsensus() or NewOpLog().
// This includes the fields from children structs. Therefore,
// it is recommended to simplify user defined types like consensus.Op
// and consensus.State as much as possible and declare all
// relevant fields as exported.
//
// A consensus.Op ApplyTo() operation may return an error. This
// means that, while the operation is agreed-upon, the resulting
// state cannot be produced. This marks the state in that node
// as dirty but does not removes the operation itself.
// See CommitOp() for more details.
//
// Using pointer types for consensus.Op and consensus.State implies
// that consensus operations will return pointers. Modifying
// a consensus.State defined as pointer, may affect the internal
// state of the Raft FSM. Therefore, it is recommended to not use
// Ops and States as pointers, and let Go perform and return
// independent copies.
